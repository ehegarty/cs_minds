First, **delete the cube by left-clicking on the cube and pressing the "Delete" key.**  You can also delete the cube by pressing "X" and clicking delete.

**The other two objects you see are the "Camera" and "Light".**  We wont be using those in this part of the tutorial, so **try deleting them yourself**.

## Step 2 - Add Monkey Head

Next, **press "Shift + A" to get a drop down menu.  Go to "_Mesh_" and select "_Monkey._"**

_**Challenge:**_ _Come up with something unique by playing with the other material settings_

## Step 4 - Moving Your Monkey Head

Ensure your monkey head is selected by left-clicking on it.

On the left side of your screen, you will see several options.  **Left-click on "_Move_".**  Three arrows will then appear on your monkey head.

![ARM Step 4](../img/intro-video1/armStep4.JPG)

**Left-click and hold on each one of these arrows to move your monkey head.**

Red Line = X axis </br>
Green Line = Y axis </br>
Blue Line = Z axis </br>

**Click in the center of the monkey head (where the white circle is) to freely move your object.**

![ARM Step 4-1](../img/intro-video1/armStep4-1.JPG)

If you have moved your monkey head and want to get it back to the center, **Press Ctrl + Z to undo.**

**_NOTE: You might have to press Ctrl + Z multiple times_**

The hotkey to move an object is "G".  Imagine "G" for Grab.

Next, **press "G" and then press X,Y, or Z to move your object along one of the colored lines, or axis. Left-Click to set it in place.**

Finally, **press "G" again and click and hold Middle Mouse Button (MMB) and drag, to snap your object to one of the axis (the colored lines). Left Click to set in place.**

**_NOTE: If you don't have a scroll wheel, go to the edit drop-down in the top left corner of Blender's interface.
Enter the preferences menu. Choose input. From here, go to the mouse section and tick 'Emulate 3 Button Mouse'._</br>
_You can now press alt + left-click as a replacement for a scroll wheel._**

## Step 5 - Rotating and Scaling Your Monkey Head

With your monkey head selected, **Left-click on "Rotate".**

![ARM Step 5](../img/intro-video1/armStep5.JPG)

**Left-click and hold on the colored arcs around the monkey head to rotate the object.** Clicking in the center of the object will cause it to rotate freely.

The hotkey for rotating is "R".  **Press "R" and then press X,Y, or Z to rotate your object along one of the colored arcs, or axis.  Left-Click to set it in place.**

**_Challenge:_** _Try and get the monkey head to face you._

![ARM Step 5-1](../img/intro-video1/armStep5-1.JPG)

Next, with your monkey head selected, **Left-click on "Scale".**

![ARM Step 5-2](../img/intro-video1/armStep5-2.JPG)

**Left-click and hold on the colored arrows around the monkey head to scale the object in different directions.**<br> Clicking in the center of the object will cause it to scale evenly in all directions


The hotkey for scaling is "S".  **Press "S" and then press X,Y, or Z to scale your object along one of the colored lines, or axis.  Left-Click to set it in place.**

![ARM Step 5-3](../img/intro-video1/armStep5-3.JPG)

**_NOTE: Scaling back to the original size can be difficult, try using Ctrl + Z to undo instead._**
