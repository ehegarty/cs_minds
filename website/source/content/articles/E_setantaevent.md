About: Learn Setanta, the new all-Irish programming language. Find out how to use Setanta to make animations, games and more, and learn some Irish along the way. Setanta is suitable for everyone, from total beginners to programming experts. We'll be taking a look at Setanta's fun interactive tutorials and seeing how to make our own games. Setanta runs in your browser, so there's no need to install anything! You can save your code online and share it with friends. You donâ€™t need to be fluent in Irish. Setanta's Irish is simple, you only use as much as you want, and the documentation and tutorials are available in English.
